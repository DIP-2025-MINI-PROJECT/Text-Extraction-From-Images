### Steps:
1. Clone Repository
```git clone https://github.com/Digital-Image-Processing-PES-ECE/project-name.git ```

2. Open In MATLAB.
```textextraction.m```

3. Add the input images given and run.


### Outputs:
* Output Images with Box bounded segmentation
* Final output text obtained in terminal

### Limitations and Future Work: 
Orientation of text in the image can hamper the accuracy. 

Accuracy of text detection can be improved by adding machine learning models.

Here it identifies text in images dominant of text, but could be upgraded to any type of image where text is passive and is difficult to be read.
